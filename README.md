# DINKIssTyle Chrome Extensions

A collection of Chrome extensions that I created because I might need them, and perhaps someone else does too.

This repository contains various unpacked Chrome extensions designed for specific utility purposes.

## How to Install

Since these are unpacked extensions, you need to install them via Chrome's Developer Mode.

1.  **Download or Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open **Google Chrome**.
3.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
4.  Toggle **Developer mode** on in the top right corner.
5.  Click the **Load unpacked** button in the top left.
6.  Select the specific folder of the extension you want to install (e.g., `Image-Information` or `save-image-as-type`).
    *   *Note: Do not select the root folder of this repository. Select the individual folder for the extension you wish to use.*
7.  The extension is now installed and ready to use!

## Extensions List
